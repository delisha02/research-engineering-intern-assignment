a fucking liberal if you let them define it then you re going to lose immediately words must mean something and theirs mean nothing a liberal is someone who wants change against what has been yes there are other definitions but we are gonna be merriam webster about this now the idea that republicans can t be liberal isn t true lincoln was a liberal republican that s important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base and prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow but we don t need to create a new movement there already exist one that is quite liberal we borrow it but we don t return it the current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything even republicans acknowledge this but they can t put their finger on it talking about voters not the elites who i m speaking of anyways doesn t matter what country you go to either left or right they own it even progressive voices acknowledge this but they put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost why is that important republicans tend to be single issue voters dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end so the single issue that has overlap is classism and the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics they have you don t the pivot must stress classism you don t always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now i wouldn t do that as you ll lose focus of the uneducated conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology but don t attack conservatives themselves just the belief in their billionaires next we must sooner rather than later pick someone to lead this the way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere obviously we all must brainstorm who that is but it cannot be sanders because of age ideally it s someone middle aged that gets young and old on board is not middle aged somewhere around is this person must not be elite or come from elites it must be grassroots you cannot have them accept from the rich they must abstain they essentially cannot be worth millions if you did not read and only scrolled towards the end the problem is that liberals who want to change things aren t focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our country s birth that needs to change and we must pivot to stress it progressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue and conservatives don t actually make up much of the country the parties do most people believe in change economic issues play one of the largest if not the largest historically and most likely always will edit but also brainstorm don t just take it from me but do understand that classism is going to play the

critical problems with trump distinct from the merely stupid offensive and painful in short i argued that the us turning its back on the liberal world order would make the world much less safe and prosperous and is a huge step backwards for mankind since then two new and unexpected developments have occured at least in their swiftness and severity the first is that musk has shown remarkable zeal in dismantling the us government and his alliance with trump has left congressional republicans never pro government types anyways silent the only remaining defense the judicial system is far too slow to stop let alone repair the damage while the us government does have genuine bloat and waste this is throwing dynamite to clean out your broom closet and the real goal and result is to hamstring the last national stalwart defender of the liberal world order the us civil service the second problem is that trump is sounding shockingly aggressive and violent all of a sudden he has floated conquest displacement if not genocide and economic pain for pain s sake it cannot be stressed enough that this is causing the leaders and top brass of every country to seriously reassess their relationship with the us and their national security strategy moving forward i have long believed and argued to my detriment that politically active people hand wring and demonize others needlessly it creates a boy cries wolf situation where we soon lack the vocabulary to proclaim a real threat when it materializes donald trump has now egregiously moved beyond the pale from merely bringing about uncertainty and economic pain to suddenly attacking our ally s core interests this is a prelude to cold and hot wars we have no effective way of communicating this because democrats already call trump the devil republicans either like this stuff or are deaf to dem warnings and the last third of america are blind to politics more broadly but to put things lightly we now have a wolf on our hands and the policy makers of other countries are probably the only ones to see it friends no more europe prepared for a trump presidency essentially in financial terms the damage he would do could be measured in dollars it was still expected he would use the american military to protect the oceans for trade to encourage stability in the me to prevent chinese aggression and give europe a nuclear umbrella trump at worst would leave nato but russia is exhausted in ukraine and poland is arming itself to the teeth so the eu could tolerate that if worst came to worst that calculus has now changed the us s major economic and military ally europe is starting to feel more threated by the us than helped by it the recent threats to mexico and canada which are essentially us vassals were so nonsensical as to amount to sadomasochism europe has begun to internalize that the us is threatening a trade war not for any addressable concern but as an end onto itself pain for its own sake trump allying with pro russian european populists and utilizing musk s disinformation to reinforce that coming out of the kremlin might be tolerated so long as the us helped in ukraine but with that help evaporating the europeans don t even know what they re gaining with america as a friend anymore by many metrics the us is now sounding and acting very much like an enemy on top of all this is a return to imperial language which the us very much has the ability to carry out trump attacking international norms and recognizing landgrabs sets the stage for the us to do the same the republican talking points that this rhetoric along with trade war threats is simply d chess leverage is not taken seriously by the policy makers of the world the small victories for trump are insignificant other countries must consider and do consider and will start to wargame for these threats to be acted upon america who needs em if we lose europe as an ally the blow to our power would be immense we lose our democratic bridgehead in eurasia and a contested atlantic even becomes a remote possibility meanwhile we ve failed to bring latin america and africa to our side so trump is simply cutting most foreign aid and just handing them to china with the expectation that threats deals can extract concessions from them when needed this ignores the role these continents will play in the coming century especially when looking at demographic trends india brazil and to a lesser extent turkey are geopolitical neutrals anyways israel and sa will stick with us as long as iran is a thing which it might not always be that basically leaves south east asia as the last area that really needs us as a military hedge against the other big gorilla in the room leaving the tpp signaled that we re a less reliable trading partner than china itself but as our friends dwindle and the atlantic and south america move further out of our orbit even the rise of china is not enough of a unifying threat to keep the pacific in our pocket for much longer china europe honestly doesn t care much about taiwan outside of semiconductors it s a pacific not atlantic problem and the business with china isn t worth risking the rest of the stuff china does is manageable and it s competing with russia in eurasia anyways in fact europe aligns with china in many ways by wanting to keep the world order alive china chiefly wants to supplant america s influence globally and gain military hegemony in its own backyard it s not clear that china has territorial ambitions beyond that which suits europe just fine this means the us really needs japan australia india and to a lesser extent south korea philippines vietnam indonesia to help in containing china but trump doesn t really hate china either his only concern seems to be the trade deficit so if america does not stop the chinese conquest of taiwan and it s quite possible china can and will take it in the next years that puts japan and south korea in incredibly vulnerable positions and they may well be forced to choose between all out war or accepting chinese hegemony and it s likely we simply lose them as allies too the entire strategic situation then changes dramatically and it becomes hard to forecast things but i want to suggest that the us and china are precluding any possibility of a pragmatic compromise between the countries both are demonizing each other as national policies and trump is trying to dismantle trade but if we give up taiwan we re going to be in an even worse position to counter their influence and may well have to live with a hostile neighbor which will probably lead to an even worse war sometime later on or we ll need to accept china as a regional partner which is complicated and anyway puts them on a collision course with a number of other strong powers japan and india in particular and i don t know how that will resolve itself peacefully in short the whole alliance structure of the region can unravel if taiwan is given up which puts the most important artery of global trade in jeopardy for the foreseeable future what have we got to lose the above conjecture of spoiling our alliances fits right in line with trump s vision of returning us and the world to the th century where we still have our enormous power base of north america white men rule the land but now we got nukes the concern that now most of the world is hostile to us probably won t matter as our old enemies are given their desired spheres of influence on a platter and regional rivalries will flare up and distract our old allies with new geopolitical realities in fact lots of countries will shamelessly court the us for assistance leading to more transactional regional foreign policy instead of some global grand strategy meanwhile mexico and canada will not be a threat for the foreseeable future and we can be energy independent if need be and or conquer venezuela greenland panama and canada are fundamentally defensive conquests in that they reinforce us control over north america i have no idea wtf trump is on about re gaza and sure americans will be poorer without trade but so will the rest of the world and without the us led alliance structures it s a strong possibility that regional conflicts will prevent mass free trading blocks to out compete the na economy of course that is the best case scenario with this antiquated outlook in all likelihood regional wars will escalate until great powers become involved and the us is inevitably dragged into conflicts overseas under unfavorable terms or soros willing some areas retain large trading blocs wherein the us is eventually out competed economically either way countries will begin to deceive resist and hedge against a hostile america and we ll pay far greater regular costs than what we paid for when we had them as friends we will resemble another china to many countries wherein they may do short term economic or even military deals with us but do not fundamentally trust us and actively work to subvert our power given every available opportunity his lasting legacy the first days was hoped to be the worst trump could offer as the president s popularity with the american people and republican party are at their peak many low hanging executive orders can be signed and there s still two years left until a mid term but knowing this the speed at which musk trump is destroying our soft power the inability of anyone to stop them and the free reign trump has to enact the new world disorder will last far far longer than his mere years in power best case scenario europe mexico and canada appease trump enough to keep our relationships alive taiwan survives this presidency the rest of the world continues using international institutions dems win congress in the mid terms renewable energy technology advances trading blocs reconfigure without the us but including china global rising real incomes continue to promote democracy the us navy still patrols the world s oceans for pirates but realistically nato won t make as much sense for europeans who ironically may try to improve relations with russia to combat american aggression and taiwan remains a giant question mark hanging over allies in the pacific even the middle east may abandon the us if israel normalizes relations with the sunnis america and russia may succeed in ruining all international orgs even as china poisons them the dems win marginally during the mid terms if at all the climate propels towards the c heating mark democracy backsliding continues aided by technological misinformation warfare and nuclear proliferation ignites all over the globe as a new security disorder manifests is there any hope i don t see many opportunities for reversing the above trends the populist nationalist movements across the free world especially the right wing ones need to die out and the next administrations of russia and china need to be more pragmatic the solution to social media misinformation needs to be discovered and most of all the american people need to punish the republicans enough in amp to give both the democrats and gop a path forward after trump the wall street wing of the gop still likes trade dems are ironically now more free trade and pro nato because of trump reactionism and trump is literally the only pro china person in the government the maga crowd are the most dangerous ideologues and there s a shot maga etiolates after their god is gone but most most of all the rest of the world needs to rebuild the liberal world order and not just the european elite or us democrats the world needs to stop playing the great powers off of each other or lamely ask what the un is gonna do for them open markets open borders open societies open progress and open minds are what lead to an open future that s the key but alas some say the lwo died in i think that s when its decline started but it lasted a good years after that is when it was killed i could be wrong i hope i am but if the pattern of the past two weeks hold i m not in fact the pain has only just begun']"

revolution and much of his writing makes reference to it he liked kropotkin in particular i initially wrote off alexander atabekian for some reason i think it s because i started with his essay on territoriality which was not the best place to start and doesn t seem reflective of his larger body of work if he had any larger works they re not on the anarchist library but what is there is succinct and echoes other classicals with a lucidity that i wasn t expecting i ve never heard atabekian s name come up in any anarchist discussion i guess it would make sense if he didn t write that much but i ve heard reclus name he didn t write much either i don t think besides the geography so here is some stuff atabekian wrote which i liked i will link each piece to each piece they re all very short more than once atabekian uses power and authority interchangeably as i think someone like louise michel does he will also occasionally make reference to moral authority i believe this is a figure of speech however maybe similar in his diction to confidence he will just as or more often repudiate authority in its entirety and lays out clearly with direct reference to right a conceptualization of the latter that seems to easily fall within the authority held in contempt by other anarchists gt what characterises anarchism what is common to all anarchists whatever their starting point and way of thinking is the rejection of authority the denial of the right of people to forcibly subjugate other people even if the power comes from a numerical majority diderot formulated this thought in the following words nature has created neither masters nor servants i want neither to make nor to receive laws the old and new in anarchism https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian the old and new in anarchism tangentially he has a second and uncompromising repudiation of democracy up to and including direct legislation gt by its other basic property the free association of individuals with the right of each of them to withdraw from the association at any time co operation excludes coercion being free and voluntary in its internal construction co operation is hostile to external violence which is an inevitable property of state power politically co operation can be neither monarchical nor republican nor democratic as v kilchevsky claims nor soviet since coercion is inherent in all power even under the most ideal state system under direct popular legislation of property equal people the majority subordinates the minority to its will co operation and anarchism https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian co operation and anarchism he talked about bolshevism a lot he didn t like it his critique of class struggle particularly as it was understood and exercised by the bolsheviks i found resonant gt thus capital from the largest to the smallest amounts are closely woven into the process of production exchange and distribution of products the class of capitalists is diffused throughout society and it is not possible to single it out into a separate class gt class struggle is the frozen dogma of the faith of all socialists and even of many anarchists the terrible consequences of the widespread dissemination and application of this scientifically untenable theory in the ignorant masses of the russian people we have seen and experienced since the february revolution especially after the triumph of the direct heirs of the international the social democrats bolsheviks in close contact for the first time in history with their co heirs the anarchists gt after the october coup d état which became so bloody thanks to the exaltation instilled by this theory the bourgeois began to be searched for but the search was in vain the crimes of capitalism were in plain sight but the criminal himself was elusive it turned out that the bourgeoisie as a class of people had been absorbed into the middle and even partly into the lower strata of the population it was possible to point to some individual rich people but even those have long since disappeared they continued to look for the bourgeoisie and in moscow they found it in the person of osip minor who had grown old because of his struggle for socialism in prisons and penal servitude and his comrades in the party in the person of the revolutionary officers and that part of the student youth which had rallied round the party of the socialist revolutionaries while the other part had joined the bolsheviks and nightmarish events took place fraternal blood was shed on both sides in glorification of the new dogma of the faith of the ignorant people the class struggle this dogma awakened the spirit of fanaticism dormant in every ignorant man and the darkest times of religious persecution were resurrected the old and new in anarchism https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian the old and new in anarchism a very kropotkin y line here i believe part of this might be a direct quote gt anarchy is above all the freedom of the individual bounded only by the equal freedom of another individual whoever he may be by conviction it is natural morality without sanction or compulsion questions of theory and practice https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian questions of theory and practice anti coercion is a big part of his project which i agree with less but i do find parts of it enchanting gt the anarchist who raises his hand to search another person even if only for weapons is no longer a proud ideological anarchist he is lower than the last policeman at least he does not hide behind the banner of freedom the anarchist who crosses the threshold of another s dwelling to search it even if only again for weapons is a criminal against the high and pure doctrine which our ideological opponents consider unattainable questions of theory and practice https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian questions of theory and practice so provided atabekian s uncompromising anti authority anarchy i see a complication of anarchism s ideological commitments that seems like it echoes through other places it is the ground floor for his anarchism opposing authority as a path to liberty and things of that nature there are more pieces some on organization his talk here is similarly eloquent he talks much about approaching anarchy as science and speaks of trouble with anarchist congresses that couldn t bind their members and otherwise became fraught with disintegration and new authorities insofar as anarchy is science for alexander atabekian this is no problem because a conference is not where those decisions are made organization is concerned principally with what is possible external constraints rather than consensus the decision making of majorities etc and i think too a thread of individual works coalescing into collective action gt just as the scientific congresses contributed little to science because no binding resolutions were possible and science develops and grows through painstaking laboratory and office work so too the anarchist congresses gave the comrades who came together an opportunity for personal communication and exchange of opinions but that was all they played no organisational role the modern anarchist movement has grown and consolidated in its original groups questions of theory and practice https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian questions of theory and practice gt we are not talking about other inconveniences of the central organization let s just say that a large part of the armenian revolutionaries experienced the destructive and harmful influence of that center on their skin and was forced to withdraw from that idea if until now those centers have not finally destroyed the cause the reason is that the cause itself is an essential organic demand for the people and continues outside the centers independently of them and often against all of them gt so in your opinion they answer us the general organization of the revolutionary force is impossible not at all the only thing that follows from what we have said is that we need to look for other means and forms of organization that we should not work in vain efforts and in vain time to form a unity of yanun activity but we must work with all our strength for the yanun revolution from which itself gave birth to a union and a permanent organization gt activity life develops a common plan of action for armenian revolutionaries then the place of current theoretical disputes will be replaced by a practical solidarity among various perfectly independent groups none of which will try to impose either its principles or its tactics on the heads of others and only then will we have a true organization an organization that will arise from vital conditions from the efforts made an organization that will be based on the direct and close relations of the working groups revolutionary organization https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian revolutionary organization some of his writing was on world war i in the problem of a free army he says that he worked as a doctor for two years in the russian army his description of the way wartime economics undermined capitalism is very interesting i don t know if it s more wholly his or if he derives this from somewhere gt the world war destroyed the foundations of the capitalist economy while the october revolution continues its work and destroys the very forms of the capitalist system gt war that factor of discord oppression and destruction this time became fruitful and constructive this was because in its unprecedented size and duration it shook up the entire economic life of the globe it became a literal war of nations and subjugated all strata of society to its equalizing demands gt it has barely disguised the extensive expropriations of private property by the name of requisitions it has destroyed free trade by fixing prices it has sought to equalise all strata of the population by food organisations for the equal distribution of essential foodstuffs in short the foundations of the capitalist system have been struck blow by blow and this not only in our own country but to an even greater extent in central and western europe the stronghold of class divisions governmental power has so far survived but even in it large holes have been punctured gt this unification of all strata of society in western europe has already begun to bear fruit it is rebuilding the social order on new principles more methodically and firmly than we have in russia this reorganisation of the social order of the west is pointed out by kropotkin in his letters on current events and only due to poor knowledge due to the conditions of wartime we can not take a closer look at this creative side of life in europe caused by the current war in russia this association emerged and blossomed in the direction of social construction in the early years of the war it found a wide field of practical application rich material and useful experience in the activities of the all russian zemsky union and other public organisations the business of organising aid to millions of refugees to whole nations became a school of practical socialism then the activity of public organisations spread to the greatest part of the population it was their fruitful activity that created our food organisations and developed the initial technique of supplying and distributing foodstuffs the old and new i thought his accusation specifically of the way authoritarian organization undermined the russian army s capacity to fight was interesting too reminiscent of bakunin who theorized that authority is caustic to expertise which alexander atabekian proposes that he witnessed in practice i do not know if this is grounded in good history but his perspective is neat gt after the february revolution which was to change the whole way of social life in the whole country it was clear to everyone that the army could not retain its old forms it too had to be renewed what did the scientifically educated officers as a professional category do to point out to the broad layers of the people and the soldiering masses the right ways for renewal exactly nothing we had officers with solid scientific knowledge and combat experience but we had no officers there was no purely professional spirit of association among our officers standing beyond and above political and social beliefs and views the army was led not by united professional workers but by disparate officials appointed at the discretion of their superiors from above this is what ruined the army in the first place gt the truth is that we did not have a purely professional association of officers on the basis of technical knowledge which would have enjoyed moral authority and would have been able to take into its own hands the work of army renewal from the very beginning our officers in the general mass without initiative without social outlook with their thinking squeezed into the deadening framework of routine were not capable of taking the lead in the reorganisation of the army on new principles and by habit became inert waiting for orders from above or clinging to the decaying old forms from above came the political agitators driven by the phantoms of the old power from above came demagogues chasing themselves after the power that intoxicates man the results we have read them in the brest peace treaty and are reading them in mirbach s notes gt from this point of view any anarchist revolutionary for defensive war is essentially an organised revolution against external state oppressors can only welcome the initiative of military affairs it is high time to make military affairs purely professional to transfer them to the healthy ground of knowledge and skill instead of what do you want and i obey before the state power gt authority can call any accumulation of people an army such as the red army but it cannot make it an army the problem of a free army https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian the problem of a free army with regards to territoriality and anarchism i have mixed feelings because i think there is an interesting point at the center of the work given a certain tendency to view humans and environments and organistic to each other although i do not know if that s a misapplication of proudhon s unity collectivity gt if we look closely at the life of individual animal families and their societies we will notice that each of them uses a certain place of residence nest burrow den anthill beehive and a relatively limited space of land i e the territory on which it harvests the means for its own existence and for the preservation of the species offspring even migratory birds and those at different times of the year return to their former home and old nest the same is observed in nomadic tribes which do not wander around the world wherever they see fit but have their own definite kyshlagi and eylagi as nomadic tatars call the places of their winter and summer stay gt the connection with the homeland is so strong in man that even with the modern extraordinary development of communication routes people are very reluctant to move from their homeland and then only under the pressure of irresistible economic necessity gt anarchism has so far put forward the territorial homeland the commune as its closest political ideal because it was easier to imagine and realise a just social order there but doom inevitably awaits the commune in a surrounding hostile environment as happened to paris in in order to establish itself anarchism must develop forms of organisation of large defensible units and then unite other countries more and more closely with its cultural influence this is the direction in which the revival of the anarchist international must be sought territoriality and anarchism https theanarchistlibrary org library alexander atabekian territoriality and anarchism i m unsure about his usage of commune as a territorial homeland however now with the additional context of his other work i m also not sure if he s using this in any particular national sense i don t think he is it almost seems like the essay is less about territoriality and more concerned with addressing the divide created by ww between anti militarist anarchists and anarchists who supported the entente his point basically seems to be that neither option makes sense and that when an anarchist homeland is created a homeland within his concept being any locality where they live and are organized towards there s a coherent basis for attacking archic forces that want to assimilate it this seems like an unobjectionable position there s some other things of his i haven t read and i will now i feel comfortable keeping his work in my back pocket as a starting point for most people as much of this seems pure anarchism and not strictly anarcho communism his collection of ideas seems like ittouches a lot of important bases and does it in an easily readable way two last quotes that seem to wrap it up gt theoretical anarchism is a science its practice must become an applied science gt you have to act to organize action constant action this is the only way to organization']"

approaching billion us dollars in damage to ukraineas of this time last year admittedly in addition to that ukraine has done some damage in kursk but unfortunately i could not find a reliable source quantifying that same with the total cost caused as a direct result of things russia has done since so while i don t have a number it is very unlikely to exceed billion and in reality is probably closer to half a trillion note source is the cannot be linked as reddit wont allow links to it but this is directly from article by vladimir putin on the historical unity of russians and ukrainians as posted on the kremlin s website i think it is worth talking about concessions in the context of the negotiation a concession is when you give up something you had if i get taken to court for committing tax fraud owing in upaid taxes i dont get to go in and demand a house that is ridiculous i broke the law this is the only starting point that reflects the fact that russia and russia alone broke the law but also does not punish russia or hold them accountable and goes as close as possible to the pre war state gt ukraine leave kursk constitutionally commit to neutrality as it was prior to the invasion gt russia leave the entire territory of ukraine crimea included pay ukraine billion and pay billion to the us for damage which was caused by russia in ukraine sanction north korea and stop trading with them gt the us lifts most sanctions on russia not all forgives ukraine billion in loans every other possible alternative requires one side to give something up the above deal is literally the only outcome where nobody concedes anything without any punishment levied on russia any other deal can be seen as a measurement of how much a country assesses its comparative ability to project power by the measure of how much has conceded v won and this means that under the best possible view of trump s plan the us would get russia to agree to the following concessions none the us would indicate to the world and show china and nato that it assesses that compared to russia the us has no leverage whatsoever and must adhere to russian demands especially in areas that are rightfully russia s because the us does not believe it is capable of asking russia to pay for anything admit responsibility for anything and also offers to give russia things and concede on direct threats to the us s own national security in addition to almost billion any outcome in which russia does not make a single concession is a victory for russia any outcome where ukraine is not given substaintial concessions from russia is a reflection on the ability of the us to influence through primarily hard power the rules and norms of international law should the us get russia to commit withdrawing from kharkiv and kherson and pay the us billion for damages it caused in ukraine that the us paid to fix and recommit to sactioning north korea and in exchange ukraine concede all of the occupied territories the us would be conceding responsibility for at least billion in damages caused by russia and conceding what trump has identified as a core strategic interest in allowing north korea to gain access to markets through russia and ukraine would be conceding their territorial integrity part of it s sovereignty and financially take responsiblity for billion in damages caused by russia this should be obviously categorically unacceptable for ukraine and ridiculous for the us the fact that the starting point the us is approaching what frighteningly could become bilateral negotiations are those in which ukraine gives up everything it gained a portion of it s soveriegnty and forced to pay billion or more in combined damages is a proof of the ability of active measures to control narratives ukraine would make those concessions at the minimum as they may make even more including in financial costs meanwhile the us is for some bizarre reason offering to make billion in concessions to russia in money it paid to fix damages russia caused and even enriching a self identified strategic interest and enemy russia meanwhile literally not making a single concession and is getting more than it is demanding how powerful does the us and the world honestly assess russia is has russia really warranted this does russia truly project hard power sufficient enough to the

publications special resources preliminary lessons ukraines offensive operations and under the false assumption most ukrainians would support russia would logically make it larger in scope than the

to force russiato the table the us demand russia do nothing while america agrees to pay billion for the damages russia caused and ukraine agrees to effectively give up its own sovereignty of it s territory and billion in financial expense which only happened due to russia s illegal actions international law is not fair but this nihilistic retreat from everything the united states sought to

ukraine and only ukraine can make decisions for ukraine the degree to which jd vance believes the us has the right to control the cultural values of its allies is directly a function of how critical the us is to the allies it supports therefore the us must use it s hard power to force russia to start from the basis i laid out a the beginning as being the starting point and ukraine can decide from

million eligible voters didn t vote in the last election if you re one of them that didn t vote because you feel like your voice doesn t matter i m not here to blame or attack you it s easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us my point is simple you matter more than you might think even if your candidate doesn t win when you show up others in your community will see they re not alone maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time let s take a closer look at why every vote matters even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red example glascock county georgia https results sos ga gov results public glascock county ga elections novgen registered voters turnout ballots cast didn t vote trump kamala harris even if all non voters had shown up and voted for kamala giving her votes trump still would have won in counties like these it s easy to feel like voting is futile example baker county georgia https results sos ga gov results public baker county ga elections novgen registered voters turnout ballots cast didn t vote trump kamala harris if just of the non voters had shown up and voted for kamala she would have won it s not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing kamala to secure the win even if your candidate doesn t win increasing turnout changes perceptions for example in glascock county vs sends a stronger message than vs it shows democrats have local support making progressive voices less isolated this visibility can energize communities spark deeper discussions and even sway centrists or independents in future elections it s not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for house seats and electoral votes for example there s an entire section of georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one if just one county in that area turns blue again it could create a ripple effect shifting the district s votes back to blue in future elections every vote contributes to a bigger picture it s not just about winning today but about shaping tomorrow s outcomes the one thing i want you to take

moment his failure to convict trump after j it is a popular sentiment here that if he wanted to mcconnell couldve convicted trump and barred him from future office i wanted to look into a what if scenario where he aggressively pursued conviction i am by no means a dc insider if there is something wrong please correct me despite trump s attempt to end the american experiment by overturning the will of the american people mcconnell allowed him to remain a force in republican politics saying all he did was not vote for the bill is underselling his complicity in protecting and abiding trump s escape from justice mitch mcconnell did not put the senate in session since the first order of business would have been the second trail of trump it s also worth noting that mitch mcconnell was only senate leader for this vital period because the georgia senators of ossoff and warnock were not sworn in on january rd with the rest of the th congress but were only sworn in on january th his refusal to immediately start the senate trial did two things first it let time pass as the moment passed political polarization can step in and battle lines can form as the horrors and shock of the insurrection grow farther political games start to creep in at the moment a vote to convict might have been justified with their constituents as images and the rare rebukes of trump by conservative media are still fresh but now right wing media free over whatever ills of trump they had has poisoned the idea of conviction the second is that it provides a legal justification for senators to hide behind or to legitimately be concerned with the legal justification is that trump is no longer in office and the senate has no jurisdiction over a private citizen in this scenario im giving gop senators some benefit of the doubt in saying that jurisdiction concerns are legitimate so they impeach him prior to him leaving office so those concern are eased new tally with justifications for senators changing votes our new starting point remember ga has two lame duck senators this quickly goes back to the original number as mcconnell and his protege john thune change their vote it s worth noting that among the non conviction voter these two had the most clear anti trump statements these senators listed the fact trump was a private citizen as the main reason why they didn t impeach and were also very critical of him often saying he did do impeachable offenses if mcconnell is whipping votes he goes perfect with these senators since they are very sympathetic to his cause and dont need persuading i put a rating on how likely i think they would vote to impeach if pressed this is from looking at their statements post j and how close they are with senate leadership john boozman shelly moore capito john hoeven jerry moran rob portman dan sullivan now we reach an impasse we need four more votes and there are tons of avenues towards these votes none of them easy avenues can be combined with others to effectively whip votes i think it should be noted that a lot of these guys probably thought trump was a political loser at the time and distancing themselves from him although hurtful to them personally was good for the national brand they certainly don t want to be on the losing side of this vote voting against mcconnell here would mean you are gonna be stripped of committee assignments in favor of those who did vote in favor mcconnell is putting his political life on the line for this vote and crossing him would incur his full wrath with only four votes to go do you really wanna be the last onboard path votes pressure the lame ducks kemp and mcconnell both put pressure on the now lame ducks senators leoffler and perdue to vote for conviction positions in a future kemp admin can be floated or positions in the rnc kemp solidifies his position as the post trump standard bearer with trump out of the way might be a little risky for kemp if it leaks he helped but i think the maga base will mostly focus on mcconnell as for perdue and loeffler they can put out a statement that will earn them infinite praise from the press and any media job they want we personally oppose the impeachment conviction of president trump however the people of georgia have spoken they have picked two senators that have made clear to us they would convict trump if in office the people of georgia elected osoff and warnock to be their representatives and in this crucial time we feel no matter our personal feelings we should vote as they would so that the people of georgia can say their current representatives speak for them for the record i don t actually believe they would think that it would be political cover for why they voted that way path votes appeal to leadership old friends mcconnell appeals to senate leadership with a mix of sticks and carrots he has personal relationships with a lot of these people so i think getting them to vote with them on this isnt out of the realm of possibility for the more craven rick scott being on the winning side matters more than anything so if he sees that two or three of his colleagues have already decided to convict they would also vote to convict signifies they have been in leadership together years or more todd young joni ernst john barrasso mike lee rick scott roy blunt mike crapo long time whip richard shelby retiring also abstained from vote creating j committee path the persuadables profiles in courage people that are a mix of political opportunists looking to get trump out of the way people that can be bribed or manipulated those who want to be on the winning team and those who despite bending over to lick the boot of trump want to see him gone if it can cost them nothing personally thom tillis marco rubio tim scott jim inhofe james lankford jim risch actually had his office trashed by the rioters tommy tuberville lindsey graham the only one on the list who actively supported trump after the insurrection but if conviction was likely he would flip in a heartbeat out of all these paths mcconnel would ve had to go ¼ which isn t that hard given the circumstances i was also very conservative in how i tallied votes i took a lot of senators at their word that they thought charges did not meet the standard to conviction even when they were critical of trump getting one vote would have made it easier to get another vote and so on after you get the four votes needed for conviction i think votes would ve been a possibility if you have leadership ambitions or want to move up at all in the senate voting against this is career suicide as for political retaliation this is a man who lost a seat in alabama during his first term in office the mitch machine vs whatever unpaid heritage foundation rejects trump scraps can find is hardly a battle without the rnc machine to back him i doubt maga candidates find the same success especially with their figurehead

relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination that is gender discrimination republican justices john roberts and neil gorsuch who were appointed by george w bush and donald trump respectively voted with the majority two republican justices voted in favor of gay rights open a us history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past years there is a group of people women gay people racial minorities etc who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others there is controversy there the issue really is as simple as one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens the latter group s entire argument is it is good when x group does it but yucky when y group does it the controversy really is as simple as that when this happens usually a few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur year after year more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests eventually pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights decades later we have reached a point where the vast majority of people barring a very small minority of people agree that the right in question should be granted to all people it is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial here are a few examples of what i mean when the constitution was first ratified women could not vote around the late th and early th century a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote most people even women themselves believed otherwise some people worried that women were too emotional to vote to that i say who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women maybe even a lot of women would not vote the same way as their husbands this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote the social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote because men will always prioritise women s interests when voting to that i say women could also prioritize men s best interests when voting after all every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life besides women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa even if men prioritize women s best interests when voting there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider when the th amendment was ratified a lot of people were mad about it nowadays the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote in fact it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote throughout the first half of the th century black where were oppressed by jim crow laws and other racist policies in the supreme court case known as plessey v ferguson it was ruled that things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate but they had to be equal the problem of course is that a lot of the time they where not equal if you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced etc apparently if a black man had just used the bathroom there is something wrong with it if a white man uses that same bathroom the white man will become infected with the black man s germs my thought process is this if we allow separate but equal there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently therefore in order to justify your belief in separate but equal you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus if you say no how do you figure plessey v ferguson was overturned in a case known as brown v board of education these days most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful fifty years ago most americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt now pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals the percentage of republicans who oppose gay rights is becoming smaller by the year fifty years from now i am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today these people will still exist but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage after all the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm that is not to say that just because a behavior has the potential to harm people that it should necessarily be illegal however only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal therefore laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public anything whether it be good bad or neutral that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public therefore if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public similarly anything good bad or neutral that could happen if a same sex couple gets married could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married i added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions because same sex unions are sterile while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life if being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex and or adopting a child then same sex couples should

fresh from feeding foreign aid into the woodchipper their work could not be more important or more risky that is because america s armed forces face a real problem not since the soviet union launched sputnik and built huge tank formations at the height of the cold war have america s military vulnerabilities been so glaring in the killing fields of ukraine america is being out innovated by drone designers in the seas and skies off china it is losing its ability to deter a blockade or invasion of taiwan the stakes are all the higher because the pentagon is a place where maga ideology meets reality mr trump s foreign policy is transactional this week he said he had begun talks with russia on the future of ukraine but it is built on the idea that peace comes through strength and that is possible only if america s forces pose a credible threat and what if doge goes rogue in the pentagon if mr musk causes chaos or corrupts procurement the consequences for america s security could be catastrophic the problems are clearest in the struggle to turn technology into a military advantage the drones over ukraine are upgraded every few weeks a pace that is beyond the pentagon s budgeting process which takes years american and european jammers in electronic warfare cost two or three times as much as ukrainian ones but are obsolete many big american drones have been useless in ukraine newer ones are pricier than ukrainian models another problem is that america s defence industry has been captured at the end of the cold war the country had prime contractors and only of defence spending went to firms that specialised in defence today just five primes soak up of the pentagon s cash wary of driving more primes out of business the department has opted for a risk averse culture contracts are typically cost plus rewarding lateness and overspending the resulting lack of productivity gains helps explain why building warships in america costs so much more than it does in japan or south korea behind this is the nightmare of budgets two year delays are aggravated by congressional squabbling pork barrelling politicians waste money by vetoing the end of programmes they guard their control over spending so jealously that without congressional permission the pentagon cannot as a rule shift more than m from one line to another too little to buy even four patriot missiles when the pentagon proposed diverting just of the defence budget to buy thousands of drones under its replicator initiative in august winning approval took almost congressional meetings pentagon angst is as old as the military industrial complex past secretaries of defence including bob gates and the late ash carter were philosopher kings next to their new and manifestly unqualified successor pete hegseth and yet the defence bureaucracy has always seemed to come out on top there are two reasons why this moment may be different one is that the time is ripe not only is the threat to american security becoming clear but a new generation of mil tech firms including anduril palantir and shield ai is banging on the pentagon s doors indeed palantir is now worth more than any of the five prime contractors more controversially mr musk is eager to crack heads together an enthusiasm which stems partly from the second reason to hope his experience elsewhere in the s to escape the ignominy of paying for rides to the international space station on russian spacecraft nasa put fixed price contracts to provide such services out to tender boeing offered something called starliner mr musk s spacex offered crew dragon at a much lower cost crew dragon has been a huge success starliner has yet to fly a successful mission and has left boeing having to absorb billions of dollars of budget overruns from to the cost of getting a kilogram into orbit hovered at around spacex rockets have already cut that by a factor of ten and promise much more helsing europe s only defence unicorn takes a similarly nimble approach to development continually updating its systems with data from the front lines mr musk s task is big and complex american weapons need more ai autonomy and lower costs where possible they should be made from cheap off the shelf parts that ride on advances in consumer tech the pentagon should foster competition and risk taking knowing that some schemes will fail a decade ago carter set up a unit for innovation but it was often seen as a threat the pentagon needs more of them it should also listen to combatant commanders too often drowned out by politics hardest of all mr trump will have to get congressional republicans to give the pentagon a freer rein to spend and innovate reforming the pentagon is much harder than other parts of government america cannot focus on preparing for war in if that involves lowering its defences today it cannot simply replace multi billion dollar submarines and bomber squadrons with swarms of drones because to project power to the other side of the world will continue to require big platforms instead america needs a department of defence that can revolutionise the economics of massive systems and accelerate the spread of novel systems at the same time mr musk and his boss are conflicted if mr trump prefers sacking generals for supposedly being woke or disloyal he will bring dysfunction upon the pentagon if mr musk and his

tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them this allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them use your logical mathematical mind to determine how kamala harris or a future democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy the response countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured multi layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology here s a logical breakdown of what kamala harris or a future democratic candidate could do prioritize narrative simplicity and consistency the problem an avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember the solution develop core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable e g working for every american use repetition to create cognitive stickiness every appearance speech and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes frame responses to attacks within this narrative for example that s another distraction we re focused on core theme use selective fact checking strategically the problem countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the illusory truth effect where repetition makes lies seem true the solution choose to debunk high impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message use a truth sandwich approach start with the truth briefly debunk the lie and return to the truth collaborate with trusted media and fact checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods humanize the campaign the problem broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding the solution focus on individual stories and human connections highlight real people and how policies affect them directly deploy surrogates trusted community voices not just politicians to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles leverage data and analytics the problem lies spread because they are emotionally engaging often through targeted digital campaigns the solution employ micro targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts monitor misinformation trends using ai and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly strengthen institutional trust the problem lies undermine trust in institutions making it easier for false narratives to thrive the solution position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform avoid defensiveness instead advocate for transparency and accountability partner with trusted non political organizations to communicate key messages call out the flood of lies the problem people may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out the solution introduce the concept of lie overload into public discourse use humor or metaphors e g trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims framing them as disrespectful to voters emphasize unity and forward looking optimism the problem lies can create polarization and fear which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives the solution offer a vision that is positive inclusive and solution oriented use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation pre bunk before debunk the problem lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared the solution anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction for example before a false claim about taxes emerges emphasize we re ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share by sticking to these strategies a democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness ultimately the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions rather than just reacting to falsehoods']"

remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective in many political debates today especially within antifascist circles the term fascism is frequently used to describe authoritarian right wing projects and figures such as trump bolsonaro or elon musk however i wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if on the contrary it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding personally i believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant however labeling figures like musk or trump as fascist seems problematic to me even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements applying this label often turns them into mere hollywood villains making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique additionally this broad use of fascism may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of today s political and economic landscape such as corporate capitalism or techno feudalism authors like murray bookchin peter gelderloos and noam chomsky have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term fascism arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading instead they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism colonialism and broader hierarchical systems edit i originally made a mistake regarding chomsky in fact he does use the term fascism quite broadly thanks to a response from dvd _anarchist on this post i can now clarify this some questions i d like to explore to what extent does fascism in its historical sense mussolini hitler etc remain a valid category for understanding today s authoritarianism does the overuse of fascism reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context from an anarchist perspective is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as fascist what do you think of the critiques from bookchin gelderloos and chomsky on this topic are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue i d love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject thanks', 'someone asked me aren t nazi s and socialists both left wing i figured i d share my response here so the nazi party calls themselves national socialists right so what happens is that people hear the word socialist and run with it this is litterally what the nazi s hoped you would do the national part people ignore is actually where the context of their beliefs lie the nazi s were nationalists so what is nationalism nationalism is a political ideology centered on promoting the interests culture and identity of a specific nation often prioritizing it above others this includes exclusion based on race religion and politics for example hitler believed the ideal german had blonde hair and blue eyes he thought jewish people leftists and a whole long list of other identitys were the opposite of german and needed to be purged from german borders but wait he killed leftists that makes no sense for a socialist to do well the reason he killed leftists was because germany had a strong leftist party during ww and he blamed them for loosing the war in fact hitler hated leftists but he did find success in populism this brings me to fascism fascism is practically the result of anti socialist philosophers trying to create a ideology that acts as a poison to socialism it takes after a lot of the insights a marxist perspective can give a politically minded person the thing is love him or hate him marx s view on global politics and power dynamics was powerful marx very sussinctly detailed the power structures in play and labeled the source of tension in society as a battle between the working class and the owning class he revealed the immense power of the working class should they unify under one banner in my mind populism is simply the art of speaking to working class people in an attempt to awaken that emmense power it s not a bad thing if your intentions are pure like that of a leftist but it is a bad thing if you are a demagogue with bad intentions fascism seeks to use the same power of populism that marx revealed and redefine the source of tension as highlighted by marx as something else for example convincing the working class that jewish people are the source of tension instead of labeling the owning class as the source and then speaking to unify the working class in their hatred of jewish people would be a form of fascism so does fascism have its roots in marxism socialism yes but only in the sense that the ideology of fascism used the foundations of marxism and built a perverted and warped version of it from the base of the perspective marx taught us but it should also be noted that in addition to the working class hitler also spoke to landlord and small buisness owners because capital ownership did not bother him socialism is very strict in its adherence to the idea that the tension will always be the owning class vs the working class it rejects all other hierarchies as a potential source of inequality exploitation that being said although hitler hated socialists his party still took the name of national socialists as a nod towards their goal of uniting the working class against all identities they vilified this is not leftist now here is the kicker do you know what other groups have a strong adherence to nationalism the kkk is one the kkk has a definition for the american culture the vilified black and brown people im sure if they somehow found a foothold of power in our political system they would reveal similar fascist tendencies as the nazis this is why maga is concerning two things are argueably true about trump he is a nationalist with stong ideas about what the american identity should be and who is or is not a real american he has populist tendencies his campaign was aimed towards the right wing working class as well as landlords and small buisness owners and he is absolutely a demagogue the same could also be said of benjamin netanyahu this one is nore controversial but i would argue that the way zionism has been playing out is strongly suggestive that israel has nationalist ambitions as well finally i ask what is the left vs the right the answer is capitalism to be far left is the belief that capitalism needs to be completely phased out with the ultimate goal if dismantling all hierarchies that can possibly be dismantled leading to pure equality justice freedom and liberty for we the people of the world i am far left i don t think it s practical yet but i hope we get there someday to be far right is to believe in an absolutely free market where capitalism can thrive unhindered i d argue that this is what anarchist capitalists believe because hitler didn t mind capitalists the nazi party is at the very least right wing because he believed in a large and very strict social hierarchy i d wager that places the nazi s and other nationalists further right don t get me wrong either i acknowledge that places like the soviet union were socialists and were also imperfect but i still think socialism is a good idea it has stuggles in the sense that capitalism works to undermine it additionally fascism was an effective poison for socialism but there are very many opinions leftists have about how socialism should be implemented that are hotley debated stalin believed an iron fist was needed to prevent the revolution from being undermined and used authoritarianism to make it so this is called marxist lennonism i argues that there needs to be a strong unwavering and somewhat oppressive socialist state due to the worry that without oppressive tendencies capitalists would rise up and use their wealth to cause corruption i consider myself a democratic socialist because i believe that for decades class consciousness has been repressed the working class don t even realize they are working class anymore but i think if we can foster class consciousness in people the power of the working class can once again be used to challenge the power structure within the owning class in a way that will hopefully someday lead to socialism']"

unpromising start byd has surpassed tesla as the world s largest maker of fully electric vehicles evs by volume and is far ahead when plug in hybrids are included the company has assisted in wresting china s car market from once dominant foreign competitors at the same time it and other chinese firms such as chery geely and saic have turned their country into the world s top exporter of vehicles speeding ahead of germany and japan china s carmakers now aspire to overthrow volkswagen and toyota at the pinnacle of the global car industry says pedro pacheco of gartner a consultancy further expanding exports is central to that the number of cars shipped abroad from china reached m last year triple the amount three years earlier according to citigroup around a third of these came from multinational brands with factories in the country the surge is set to continue in the bank reckons sales abroad will hit m that has led to much consternation among incumbent carmakers with particular attention paid to the growing number of chinese evs on european roads yet the bulk of china s car exports nearly three quarters last year are powered by internal combustion engines ices and most are aimed neither at western europe nor america but at the rest of the world car carrying vessels are departing china s ports in ever greater numbers in part because the domestic market where m passenger vehicles were sold last year is neither as fast growing nor as profitable as in the past chinese consumers once opted mostly for foreign brands but these days domestic carmakers account for around three fifths of sales in the country as harald hendrikse of citigroup notes at home the chinese have won victory has come at a price however creating a homegrown ev industry using subsidies and other government inducements has resulted in severe overcapacity chinese factories could perhaps turn out nearly m cars a year equivalent to around half of all global sales yet they operate at only of that capacity according to bernstein a broker oversupply has led to a vicious price war seeking an alternative outlet chinese carmakers have turned abroad byd geely and great wall have said that margins are five to ten percentage points higher on sales overseas as the incentive to export strengthens however the opportunities to do so are diminishing last year the eu imposed tariffs on chinese made evs to combat what it regards as unfair subsidies chinese brands share of ev sales in europe grew from around in to in but may now climb to only by according to schmidt automotive research a consultancy if that door is slightly ajar others are firmly shut tariffs of imposed during joe biden s presidency in effect bar chinese evs from america a further levy of on chinese goods recently imposed by donald trump will not have much additional impact fierce loyalty to domestic brands in japan and south korea and rocky diplomatic relations with india have kept chinese carmakers at bay in those countries switching lanes undeterred these firms have shifted their focus to countries in south east asia the middle east latin america and even africa although each is relatively small taken together they account for m sales or more most are fast growing unlike rich countries or china and do not have a big domestic industry that would lobby for protection emissions and other regulations are also not as strict notes felipe munoz of jato another consultancy opportunism has played a role in this a shortage of chips during the pandemic prompted western carmakers to concentrate on their priciest and most profitable vehicles in their biggest markets rather than cheaper models better suited to developing countries that left a gap for china to fill western sanctions helped too the biggest importer of chinese cars is russia when western carmakers pulled out after its invasion of ukraine the share of chinese brands surged from in to in according to rhodium group one more

china s advance chinese carmakers are powering ahead elsewhere they now have of the market in the middle east and africa in south america and in south east asia according to bernstein up from almost nothing a few years ago the take up rate of evs in these countries is lower than in rich ones and most of the cars chinese firms sell are ice models but having established themselves their long term

in according to citi chinese carmakers will not only ship from home they want to establish footholds by building factories abroad to sidestep tariffs avoid shipping costs and keep close to customers byd is in the vanguard it is making vehicles in thailand and uzbekistan with plants in brazil hungary indonesia turkey and perhaps mexico to follow others including chery changan great wall and saic

america if chinese competition abroad causes legacy firms to concentrate on protected markets like america and europe competitive pressure will increase there too building brands signing on dealers
